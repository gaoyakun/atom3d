##  LinkWith target : libs
##    Link an application with libraries. The specified libraries should have
##    build rules in the same project. For external libraries use the
##    ExternalLibs rule. Specify the library names without any extensions or
##    the leading "lib".
rule LinkWith
{
  local rawlibs = [ ResolveLibs $(>) ] ;

  if ( $($(<)_TYPE) = library ) && ( "$($(<)_SHARED)" = "" )
  {
    # LibDepends for shared libs invokes LinkWith, so prevent recursion
    LibDepends $(<) : $(rawlibs) ;
  }                           
  
  LFlags $(<) : $($($(rawlibs).EXTERNALLIBS).LFLAGS) ;
  
  local i libs ;
  for i in $(rawlibs)
  {
    libs += [ ConstructLibraryLinkTarget $(i) : $($(i)_SHARED) ] ;
  }

  NEEDLIBS on $($(<)_TARGET) += $(libs) ;

  if $($(<)_TYPE) = plugin
  {
    $(<)_static.NEEDLIBS += $(>) ;
  }
}

##  CFlags target : flags [ : options ]
##    Sets cflags on all sourcefiles of a library, plugin or application target
##    This rule affects c++ and c compiler flags.
##    Options
##      nostatic - Do not apply the flags to a "_static" variation.
rule CFlags
{
  CheckOptions nostatic : $(3) : $(<) ;

  CCFLAGS on $($(<)_OBJECTS) += $(>) ;

  {
    CFlags $(<)_static : $(>) ;
  }

  UnitTestCFlags $(<) : $(>) : $(3) ;
}

##  LFlags target : flags [ : options ]
##    Sets linker flags for a library, plugin or application target
##    Options
##      nostatic - Do not apply the flags to a "_static" variation.
rule LFlags
{
  CheckOptions nostatic : $(3) : $(<) ;

  LINKLIBS on $($(<)_TARGET) += $(>) ;

  {
    $(<)_static.LFLAGS += $(>) ;

}

##  ExternalLibs target : identifiers
##    Specify a dependency between 'target' and the external libraries
##    indicated by 'identifiers'.  If 'target' is an application or plugin,
##    then it is linked against the indicated external libraries.  If 'target'
##    is a library, then its dependency upon 'identifiers' is noted, and
##    applications or plugins which link against 'target' will also be linked
##    against the libraries indicated by 'identifiers'.  'identifiers' is a
##    list of base names of a set of variables which provide build tool
##    information about each external library.  In particular, assuming that
##    `ident' is one element of `identifiers', the value of $(ident).CFLAGS
##    should provide compiler flags needed for the external library indicated
##    by 'ident'; and $(ident).LFLAGS should provide linker flags for the
##    library.
rule ExternalLibs
{
  local i ;
  for i in $(>)

    CFlags $(<) : $($(i).CFLAGS) ;
    LFlags $(<) : $($(i).LFLAGS) ;
    
    if $($(<)_TYPE) = library
    {
      $(<).EXTERNALLIBS += $(i) ;
    }
  }
}

##  ExtraObjects target : objectfiles [ : options ]
##    Link additional object files with a target.
##    Options:
##      inheritcflags: The mentioned object files will inherit compiler flags
##      assigned to target's normal object files (in addition to any flags
##      already set manually).
rule ExtraObjects
{
  CheckOptions inheritcflags : $(3) : $(<) ;
  if [ IsElem inheritcflags : $(3) ]

##  ResolveLibs libs
##    Given a list of libraries, augment the list by adding other libraries
##    upon which the given libraries depend.  Dependencies between libraries
##    are specified via LibDepends (or LinkWith when the target is a library).
##    The returned list is ordered such that it is suitable for Unix linkers
##    which are sensitive to the order of libraries in the invocation
##    statement.
rule ResolveLibs
{
  local i libs ;
  for i in $(<)
  {
      libs += $(i) $($(i)_depends) ;

  # We must eliminate the duplicates in reverse order in order to ensure that
  # we do not destroy the overall library ordering since Unix linkers are
  # order-sensitive.
