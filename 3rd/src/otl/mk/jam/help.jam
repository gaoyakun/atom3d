##  Description target [ : description ]
##    Provides access to the description of 'target'. The description may be
##    used by other rules, such as those which generate project files, or which
##    present informative messages to the user regarding 'target'. If invoked
##    with two arguments, then it sets the description of 'target'. If invoked
##    with one argument, then it returns the description of 'target'. You
##    should invoke this rule to set the description before invoking other
##    rules which might need access to target's description, such as the
##    Application, Library, and Plugin rules. As a convenience, several generic
##    rules, such as Application, Library, and Plugin will automatically invoke
##    the Help rule for 'target' using the provided 'description'.

  if $(desc)

  }

  }
  return $(desc) ;
}


##  Help target : description
##    Specify the 'description' to emit for 'target' when the user invokes "jam
##    help".
