# This file contains functions and configurations for generating PC-Lint build
# targets for your CMake projects.

# a phony target which causes all available *_LINT targets to be executed
add_custom_target(ALL_LINT)

# add_pc_lint(target source1 [source2 ...])
#
# Takes a list of source files and generates a build target which can be used
# for linting all files
#
# The generated lint commands assume that a top-level config file named
# 'std.lnt' resides in the configuration directory 'PC_LINT_CONFIG_DIR'. This
# config file must include all other config files. This is standard lint
# behaviour.
#
# Parameters:
#  - target: the name of the target to which the sources belong. You will get a
#            new build target named ${target}_LINT
#  - source1 ... : a list of source files to be linted. Just pass the same list
#            as you passed for add_executable or add_library. Everything except
#            C and CPP files (*.c, *.cpp, *.cxx) will be filtered out.
#
# Example:
#  If you have a CMakeLists.txt which generates an executable like this:
#
#    set(MAIN_SOURCES main.c foo.c bar.c)
#    add_executable(main ${MAIN_SOURCES})
#
#  include this file
#
#    include(/path/to/pc_lint.cmake)
#
#  and add a line to generate the main_LINT target
#
#   if(COMMAND add_pc_lint)
#    add_pc_lint(main ${MAIN_SOURCES})
#   endif(COMMAND add_pc_lint)
#
